;; QUALITY DASHBOARD
;; First, let's create functions to prepare data for each visualization type

(defn prepare-temporal-coverage-data [ds]
  (-> ds
      ;; Group by station and time window (e.g. day or week)
      (tc/group-by [:station-id :time-window])
      (tc/aggregate
        {:data-completeness #(let [total (count (% :count))
                                  valid (count (remove nil? (% :count)))]
                              (/ valid total))
         :has-data #(pos? (count (remove nil? (% :count))))})
      ;; Add station metadata like installation date
      (tc/left-join station-metadata :station-id)))

(defn prepare-station-reliability-data [ds]
  (-> ds
      (tc/group-by [:station-id])
      (tc/aggregate
        {:uptime-pct #(* 100 (/ (count (remove nil? (% :count)))
                                (count (% :count))))
         :median-count #(stats/median (remove nil? (% :count)))
         :suspicious-pct #(* 100 (/ (count (filter :is-suspicious %))
                                   (count (% :count))))})))

(defn prepare-missing-data-patterns [ds]
  (-> ds
      (tc/group-by [:hour :day])
      (tc/aggregate
        {:missing-pct #(* 100 (/ (count (filter nil? (% :count)))
                                (count (% :count))))
         :total-observations #(count (% :count))})))

(defn prepare-quality-timeline [ds]
  (-> ds
      ;; Group by time window (e.g. week)
      (tc/group-by [:time-window])
      (tc/aggregate
        {:active-stations #(count (distinct (% :station-id)))
         :data-completeness #(* 100 (/ (count (remove nil? (% :count)))
                                      (count (% :count))))
         :suspicious-pct #(* 100 (/ (count (filter :is-suspicious %))
                                   (count (% :count))))})))

;; Now let's create the actual visualization code.
;; I'll leave placeholders for the tableplot implementation:

(defn create-temporal-coverage-plot [coverage-data]
  ;; TODO: Implement with tableplot
  ;; Should create a grid visualization where:
  ;; - X-axis is time
  ;; - Y-axis is stations
  ;; - Color represents data completeness
  (comment
    "Pseudocode for plot structure:
     - Use a heatmap-style visualization
     - X-axis should be time series from 2012-2024
     - Y-axis should be stations, ordered by installation date
     - Color gradient from white (no data) to dark blue (complete data)
     - Add markers or lines for installation dates"))

(defn create-station-reliability-dashboard [reliability-data]
  ;; TODO: Implement with tableplot
  ;; Should create multiple plots:
  ;; 1. Bar chart of uptime percentages
  ;; 2. Distribution of median counts
  ;; 3. Suspicious value percentages
  (comment
    "Pseudocode for dashboard structure:
     - Main panel showing uptime % as horizontal bars
     - Secondary panel showing median counts distribution
     - Color coding based on reliability thresholds
     - Add reference lines for acceptable thresholds"))

(defn create-missing-data-calendar [missing-patterns]
  ;; TODO: Implement with tableplot
  ;; Should create a calendar heatmap showing:
  ;; - Days of week vs hours
  ;; - Color intensity for missing data frequency
  (comment
    "Pseudocode for calendar heatmap:
     - 7x24 grid for week hours
     - Color gradient for missing data percentage
     - Add annotations for systematic patterns
     - Include marginal distributions"))

(defn create-quality-timeline [timeline-data]
  ;; TODO: Implement with tableplot
  ;; Should create a multi-line plot showing:
  ;; - Active stations over time
  ;; - Data completeness
  ;; - Suspicious value frequency
  (comment
    "Pseudocode for timeline:
     - Multiple Y-axes for different metrics
     - Line plots for each quality metric
     - Add important events as annotations
     - Include trend lines"))

;; Function to generate all plots
(defn generate-quality-report [clean-data]
  (let [coverage-data (prepare-temporal-coverage-data clean-data)
        reliability-data (prepare-station-reliability-data clean-data)
        missing-patterns (prepare-missing-data-patterns clean-data)
        timeline-data (prepare-quality-timeline clean-data)]
