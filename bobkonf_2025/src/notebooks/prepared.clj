;; # Exploring bicycle traffic in Berlin
;; _BobKonf 2025, Berlin

;; Getting insights from data. The whole point is to try to answer a question.

;; In this workshop we'll explore Clojure's data science toolkit, using it to walk through
;; exploring and analyzing a [dataset about bicycle traffic in Berlin](https://daten.berlin.de/datensaetze/radzahldaten-in-berlin).

;; Today we'll explore how bicycle usage in Berlin has evolved over time. By the end of the workshop we'll be able to answer questions like:
;; - What are the most travelled bicycle routes in the city?
;; - How did the pandemic affect bicycle usage in Berlin?
;; - How is bicycle traffic affect by time of day, day of the week, or time of year?

;; ## Overview
;; 1. Setup and intro (15 mins)
;;   Hopefully you have already installed Clojure and one way or another have a working Clojure environment. We'll make sure everyone is set up to follow along and take a very quick tour of Clojure's as a language before diving in to the specific libraries we'll use for a more realistic data analysis.
;;
;; 2. Data loading and exploration (20 mins)
;;   We'll learn how to load data from the internet into a tablecloth dataset, how to parse excel files, and how to explore it so we can see what we're working with.

;; 3. Data cleaning and transformation (20 mins)
;;   Once we have a sense of what our data looks like, we'll learn how to clean it up, transforming into an "alaysis-ready" dataset.

;; 4. Analysis, visualization and reporting
;;   After we have a tidy dataset usable for analysis, we'll get to work answering some of our original questions.

;; 5. Integration and production-readiness
;;   This is where the reproducibility parts comes in. As we go, we'll architect our data wrangling and analysis code in a way that makes it easy to re-run. We'll see how easy it is to deploy a dashboard based on our analysis.

;; ## 2. Data loading and exploration

;; ## 2.1 Loading data from the internet

;; First we'll download the dataset from the source.

;; ::: {.callout-note}
;; **Note:** If you haven't already done this and the internet is slow or the download is not working for some reason, the file is also included in this repo already as `data/2025-11-13/raw-data.xlsx`
;; :::

;; Our dataset is described on the [Berlin open data portal](https://daten.berlin.de/datensaetze/radzahldaten-in-berlin).

;; ::: {.callout-tip}
;; We should always check first that a given dataset is appropriately licensed for our use case. This dataset is licensed under the permissive [DL-DE->Zero-2.0 license](https://www.govdata.de/dl-de/zero-2-0), so we are free to use it without restrictions or conditions.
;; :::

;; The dataset is available using this link:
(def dataset-source-url "https://www.berlin.de/sen/uvk/_assets/verkehr/verkehrsplanung/radverkehr/weitere-radinfrastruktur/zaehlstellen-und-fahrradbarometer/gesamtdatei-stundenwerte.xlsx?ts=1737968619")

;; To download the dataset file, we'll use `clj-http` to stream the file contents to our local disk. The quickest way is to just stream the data directly to a file with a hard-coded name:

;; ::: {.callout-tip}
;; This will download the dataset, which is 16.1MB. If you are on a slow or limited-bandwidth connection, you may prefer to skip evaluating it and use the data that is already downloaded to this repo, in `data/raw-data.xlsx`
;; :::

(comment
  (let [response (http/get dataset-source-url {:as :byte-array})
        file-name "data/prepared/raw-data.xlsx"]
    (io/make-parents file-name)
    (with-open [output (io/output-stream file-name)]
      (io/copy (:body response) output))))

;; This works for now. Later in the workshop we'll see how we can make it more robust and reliable for deploying to production.

;; 2.2 Loading xlxs data in Clojure

;; To load xlsx data we'll need to require fastexcel:

(require '[tech.v3.libs.fastexcel :as xlsx])

(def file-name "data/prepared/raw-data.xlsx")

;; Attempting to load the excel file as a dataset directly shows us that there are actually 16 datasets contained in this workbook:
(tc/dataset file-name)

;; So instead we'll make a seq of datasets, loading each sheet as its own dataset:

;; ::: {.callout-tip}
;; TODO: explain `defonce`? Or maybe just don't use it..
;; :::

(def datasets
  (xlsx/workbook->datasets file-name))

;; We can see what our sheets are named like this:
(map tc/dataset-name datasets)

;; The first three are reference datasets and the rest are a time series. This is pretty common. We'll extract some metadata out of these first three datasets to use in our final report. The first dataset just contains a big description, formatted for aesthetics rather than machine-readability, so we'll have to dig in to a random cell in the middle to get the content out.

;; First we'll drop all the columns where every value is nil, which we can see leaves us with a single column:

(def info-ds (first datasets))

(tc/drop-columns info-ds (fn [col] (every? nil? (info-ds col))))

;; Then we'll join all the non-nil values in this column into a single wall of text, and store it as the description for this dataset.
(->> (tc/drop-columns info-ds (fn [col] (every? nil? (info-ds col))))
     tc/rows
     flatten
     (remove nil?)
     (map str/trim)
     (str/join "\n")
     (spit "data/prepared/description-de.txt"))

;; You'll notice this description is in German. As a quick bonus step, we can translate it to German using a free online translation API. To follow this particular example you'll need an API key from [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/en/pro#developer).

(comment
  (require '[clojure.java.shell :as sh])

  (let [key (->> "secrets/translate-api-key.txt.gpg" (sh/sh "gpg" "--decrypt") :out str/trim)
        response (http/post "https://api-free.deepl.com/v2/translate"
                            {:body (json/write-str {:text [(slurp "data/prepared/description-de.txt")]
                                                    :target_lang "EN"})
                             :headers {"Authorization" (str "DeepL-Auth-Key " key)}
                             :content-type :json})
        english (-> response :body json/read-str (get-in ["translations" 0 "text"]))]
    (spit "data/prepared/description-en.txt"
          (str "NOTE: THIS CONTENT IS A MACHINE TRANSLATION OF THE ORIGINAL IN data/prepared/description-de.txt\n"
               "provided only for convenience with no guarantee of accuracy.\n\n"
               english))))

;; Next we'll look at the "Legende" sheet to see what we can learn about our dataset from it.

(second datasets)

;; This does not appear to be very useful. We'll come back to it if it seems like it might be interesting later on.

;; Next is the "Standortdaten" sheet:

(nth datasets 2)

;; This is useful information about the different tracker locations. It also reveals our first encounter with one very annoying thing about working with Excel files -- dates. Very annoyingly, dates in excel are stored as number of days since 1900-1-1. We'll do some basic transformations to this dataset, and store it as a CSV file.

(-> datasets
    (nth 2)
    ;; It's idiomatic to use keywords as column names in Clojure, so we'll translate these to English and make them keywords
    (tc/rename-columns {"Z채hlstelle" :station-id
                        "Beschreibung - Fahrtrichtung" :direction
                        "Breitengrad" :lat
                        "L채ngengrad" :long
                        "Installationsdatum" :installed})
    ;; We'll parse the installation date values as dates based on Excel's idiosyncratic date handling
    (tc/update-columns :installed (partial map dates/parse-excel-cell-as-date))
    ;; Save this transformed data
    (tc/write-csv! "data/prepared/location-info.csv"))

;; Now we get into the interesting work. Inspecting one of the annual data files we can see that this dataset is stored in a very wide format with bad column names

;; This data is a mess. The one saving grace is that all years of data are messy in the same way.

(def data-2012 (nth datasets 3))

data-2012

(tc/column-names data-2012)

(map tc/column-names datasets)

;; Parse dates on ingestion and reload the data, will be much more efficient:

(def datasets
  (let [is-1904-system? (dates/is-1904-system? file-name)]
    (xlsx/workbook->datasets "data/prepared/raw-data.xlsx"
                             {:parser-fn {"Z채hlstelle        Inbetriebnahme"
                                          [:packed-local-date-time
                                           (partial dates/parse-excel-cell-as-date is-1904-system?)]}})))

;; Figure out how to parse a single dataset first

(def data-2012 (nth datasets 3))

;; Inspect a single one:
(tc/info data-2012)

;; Data is very sparse. We'll make it tidy and assume a missing value later implies `nil`, rather than explicitly including blank cells in our cleaned datasets.

(let [;; Get the names of all empty columns that are not empty
      non-empty-columns (-> data-2012
                            tc/info
                            (tc/select-rows (comp pos? :n-valid))
                            :col-name)]
  ;; Select only those
  (-> data-2012
      (tc/select-columns (set non-empty-columns))
      ;; Now fix the column names
      ;; First column is always the date
      (tc/rename-columns {"Z채hlstelle        Inbetriebnahme" :date})
      ;; Then we'll strip the date part off the end of the rest of the column names. Regex isn't super efficient, but that's fine we're only ever working with a small number of columns. Since these are domain-specific IDs, we'll leave them as-is, rather than converting them to keywords or something else.
      (tc/rename-columns (complement #{:date}) #(->> % (re-matches #"^(.+)\d{2}\.\d{2}\.\d{4}") second str/trim))
      ;; Now we'll make the data "tidy". It's not super obvious why this is necessary with a small dataset like this, but it will be for the ones that have more columns
      (tc/pivot->longer (complement #{:date}) {:target-columns :station-id
                                               :value-column-name :count})
      ;; Then save this for later
      (tc/write! "data/prepared/data-2012.csv")))

;; Great. Now we need to process the rest of the data.
