# Conclusion

In this workshop we've worked through an end-to-end data processing workflow with Clojure's toolkit:

We've explored how to:

- Load and manipulate data using tablecloth's dataframe-like operations
- Perform exploratory data analysis with Clojure's functional approach
- Visualize data with tableplot
- Apply statistical methods and data transformations in a clean, composable way
- Leverage Clojure's REPL-driven development for interactive data exploration

## Keep in touch!

One thing we didn't get to fully experience in this workshop is the amazing community working on all of these tools. To keep in touch, the best place is to join the Clojurians zulip instance. Most of the Clojure-for-data people hang out in the #data-science channel there.

You can also always reach out to me personally, I'm happy to chat about any of this stuff or connect you to anyone you might be interested in meeting or working with:
