# Workshops

This is a collection of workshops I've put on in recent years. Each folder is a self-contained project containing instructions, data, and notebooks for following along.

### [Clojure for Data Deep Dive](./london_clojurians_april_2024/README.md)

This was first presented at the London Clojurians online meetup in April, 2024. It's a whirlwind tour of Clojure's data science ecosystem, with examples of how to accomplish some non-trivial tasks using Clojure's data science toolkit.

At the time of the recording the libraries shown were in various states of maturity. The underlying data type and dataset libraries ([dtype.next](https://github.com/cnuernber/dtype-next/tree/master) and [tech.ml.dataset](https://github.com/techascent/tech.ml.dataset)) are very mature and stable. The ML and statistics libraries are functional and stable, but not necessarily in their final forms. The visualization libraries are still under very active development and will certainly evolve more in the coming months. This presentation represents the best of Clojure's current set of building blocks for working with data.
